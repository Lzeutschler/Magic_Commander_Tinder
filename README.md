# Brewmance

A web app for Magic: The Gathering Commander players:

1. **Deck Matchmaker** (live): pick a commander and a bracket, then swipe through cards that fit.
   The deck keeps its mana curve, ramp, draw, interaction, board wipes, protection and finishers in balance,
   with targets tuned to what EDHREC decks of that commander play, and respects the bracket's Game Changer,
   mass land denial, extra-turn and two-card combo limits (combos via Commander Spellbook). Deck settings
   (land count, role targets, curve, synergy vs. staples, budget per card, Game Changers) can be changed
   before and while swiping. Finish with basics, edit, import and export, or share the deck as a link
   (`/d/<code>`: the list itself, deflated into the URL, with a preview image for Reddit and Discord). See
   [docs/deckbuilding-review.md](docs/deckbuilding-review.md) for the reasoning behind the numbers.
2. **Goldfish** (live): an MTG Arena-style sandbox to test a deck. Drag cards between zones, click to
   play or tap, right-click for counters, tokens, flip and zone moves. London mulligan (first one free),
   scry/surveil/mill/search, commander tax, undo, keyboard shortcuts (D, U, N, S, M, ⌘Z) and an
   opening-hand simulator.
3. **Commander quiz** (live, `/quiz`): newcomers answer seven vibe questions (hero or villain, favorite
   universe such as Lord of the Rings or Marvel, creatures, art mood); experienced players answer seven
   questions about win condition, engine, table politics, tempo, complexity, colors and creature types.
   Then they swipe through the best-matching commanders with a "why this fits" for each, toggle popular
   picks vs. hidden gems, and start the deckbuilding swipe from their shortlist or share it as a link
   (`/q/<code>`, with a preview image).

Decks are stored in the browser (localStorage); there are no accounts.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, Cache Components) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS v4 · shadcn/ui (Base UI) ·
Motion · dnd-kit · Zustand · TanStack Query · Zod · Recharts · Vitest · Playwright. Deploys to Vercel as is.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` first run `scripts/build-card-db.ts`, which downloads Scryfall's bulk data
(about 30 MB, cached in `.cache/`) and writes:

| File | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| `data/cards.json` | API routes: every Commander-legal card with roles (ramp, draw, removal, …) |
| `data/tokens.json` | API routes: tokens for the goldfish sandbox (`/api/tokens`) |
| `public/data/commanders.json` | Client: all legal commanders with themes, tribes, archetypes and set |

The data is rebuilt when it is older than a week; `pnpm data --force` rebuilds it now.

Other scripts: `pnpm test` (Vitest), `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright smoke test; needs network for EDHREC and
Scryfall, run `pnpm exec playwright install chromium` once; `PORT=3001 pnpm test:e2e` runs it against a dev
server on another port), `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`.

## Design

"Arcane Slate", a tabletop look rather than stock shadcn: cool graphite surfaces, periwinkle as the brand
accent (`brand`, blue mana / planeswalker spark) and teal for secondary highlights (`teal`, also the maybe
pile). Text and accents meet WCAG AA (text 15.6:1, brand 7.7:1 on the background). Tokens live in
`app/globals.css`; `lib/brand.tsx` mirrors them as hex for the generated icons and Open Graph image.

- **Name:** the site name lives only in `SITE.name` (`lib/site.ts`); header, footer, metadata, legal pages
  and the Open Graph image read it from there, and the logo mark has no lettering.
  The browser storage keys `commander-tinder` and `commander-tinder-quiz` keep the old name on purpose:
  renaming them would drop every saved deck and quiz.
- **Type:** Alegreya for headings, Archivo (with its width axis) for UI and body text. `ui-label` gives
  semi-condensed labels in sentence case, `numeral` big tabular counters. No upper-case eyebrows over
  headings, no gradient text.
- **Shape:** small radii (3px controls, 6px panels, 8px dialogs); cards keep their printed 4.75% corner.
  Shadows are hard ink edges plus a short drop (`shadow-sm` … `shadow-2xl` are redefined), no glows.
- **Surfaces:** `panel` (raised), `panel-inset` (recessed well), `playmat` (goldfish table). These are
  `@utility` classes, so variants such as `hover:` or `[&_h3]:` work on them.
- **Icons:** [Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com) in the bold weight via `components/icons.tsx`, plus
  the [Mana](https://mana.andrewgioia.com) font (SIL OFL) for tap and card type symbols (`ManaGlyph`).
  Mana costs stay Scryfall's SVGs. Import icons from `@/components/icons`, not from an icon package.

## Data sources

- **[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/docs/api)**: card data, images and the Game Changer flag
  (`game_changer`). Card roles come from Scryfall Tagger oracle tags (`oracle_tags` bulk file).
- **[EDHREC](https://edhrec.com)**: per-commander card suggestions with synergy and inclusion,
  filtered by bracket and theme. EDHREC has no official API; the app reads the JSON its own site uses
  (`json.edhrec.com/pages/commanders/{slug}[/{bracket}][/{theme}].json`) through a cached server
  route and falls back to its own popularity/theme scoring when EDHREC has no data.
- **Commander archetypes** for the quiz (`lib/tagging/archetypes.ts`) combine Scryfall Tagger tags on
  each commander with EDHREC theme pages (`pages/tags/{theme}.json`, top commanders per theme) and color
  pages (`pages/commanders/{colors}.json`, deck totals). The card database build fetches these ~85
  pages, caches them in `.cache/edhrec/` for a week and keeps going without them if EDHREC is down.

## Deployment

The app deploys to Vercel as is: import the repository, keep the detected Next.js preset and the default
build command (`pnpm build`, which first downloads the Scryfall bulk data).

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | recommended | Public origin without trailing slash, e.g. `https://brewmance.com`. Used for `metadataBase` (canonical and Open Graph URLs), `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`. |

Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, `lib/site.ts` falls back to Vercel's `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`
(the production domain, set automatically) and then to `http://localhost:3000`. Set it for Production
in *Project Settings → Environment Variables* once the custom domain is live, then redeploy.

### Domain

Add the domain in *Project Settings → Domains*, point DNS to Vercel as shown there, and redirect the
`www` variant (or the apex) to the primary domain. Vercel issues the TLS certificate. Then set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the primary domain.

Optional: set *Functions → Region* to Frankfurt (`fra1`) so API routes run in the EU.

### Weekly card data refresh (Deploy Hook)

1. In Vercel, *Project Settings → Git → Deploy Hooks*, create a hook for the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, *Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*, add the hook URL as `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`.

`.github/workflows/refresh-card-data.yml` calls the hook every week, which rebuilds the site with fresh
Scryfall data.

### Security headers

`next.config.ts` sends a Content Security Policy (images and mana symbols only from `cards.scryfall.io`
and `svgs.scryfall.io`, no framing), `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Permissions-Policy`,
`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and HSTS. Preview deployments additionally allow `vercel.live` for the
Vercel Toolbar. If you add a third-party script, image host or API that the browser calls directly,
extend the CSP there and update the privacy policy (`app/datenschutz/page.tsx`).

### Before going live

- Brewmance runs as Leonard's private, non-commercial hobby project, which fits Vercel's Hobby plan.
  Provider details for `/impressum` and `/datenschutz` live in `lib/site.ts` (`OPERATOR`).
- If the project ever earns money (ads, donations, paid features) or moves to a company, revisit the
  Impressum, the privacy policy and the Vercel plan.

## Pages and SEO

`/about`, `/impressum` and `/datenschutz` (German, with an English translation; `/imprint` and `/privacy`
redirect there). Metadata, Open Graph and Twitter cards are set in `app/layout.tsx`; the social image
(`app/opengraph-image.tsx`), favicon (`app/icon.svg`), Apple touch icon, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and
the web app manifest are generated from `app/`.
